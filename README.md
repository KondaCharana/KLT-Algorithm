# KLT-Algorithm-Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi algorithm 
Feature Detection:
Detect keypoints in the first frame using corner detection algorithms like Harris corner detector or Shi-Tomasi corner detector.
Feature Tracking:
For each keypoint in the first frame:
Search for corresponding points in a small neighborhood in the next frame.
[It uses methods like Lucas-Kanade optical flow or pyramidal Lucas-Kanade to estimate the displacement of keypoints.]
Use techniques like Lucas-Kanade optical flow or pyramidal Lucas-Kanade to estimate motion vectors.
Motion Estimation:
Calculate the motion vector for each keypoint, representing the displacement between frames.
Store the motion vectors for further processing.
[Motion vectors are typically calculated using motion estimation techniques, such as optical flow algorithms like Lucas-Kanade or Horn-Schunck. These algorithms analyze the pixel intensity patterns between frames to estimate the apparent motion of objects or features.]
Object Tracking:
Bounding boxes can be drawn around the regions of interest based on the motion of keypoints, allowing for object tracking and localization in the video.
